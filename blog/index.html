			<p>28/02/2023 - The black monster energy tastes like blueberries</p>
			<p>27/02/2023 - Today marks a month of me writing on here. I have learned nothing except maybe some of the upper bounds of my autism. I collected my delivery that I missed on Saturday before going to work. I had a pretty chill day at work although I much rather doing the early shifts, 10-6 can really drag and it feels like you have less time in your day. I started cultivating my mymycelium sheet.</p>
			<p>26/02/2023 - As per usual, I had to see a few people in the morning, then I went to get a big breakfast and went on another long walk. I'm not sure why this has become so routine, there's a certain peace of walking aimlessly for a couple hours without your phone to disturb you that is otherwise hard to aquire. I went to put air in my tires and there's something slightly embarassing and infuriating about having to sit there and fiddle with the air pump. You really don't have much control, you are just suceptiable to the little tricks the machine plays, like trying to catch a fast moving ping-pong ball...</p>
			<p>25/02/2023 - I took my dog on a long walk this morning over the Ash Vale ranges. You can see Woking from one side of the ranges and wow, what an eye-sore! Other than that, bing chilling. I saw one of my friends later that night, we hung out for a while, then I went home and had the most dreamless, , fast-travel-esque, rock hard sleep of my life.</p>
			<p>20-24/02/2023 - I'll update this whole week with a short update as I am writing this on the following Monday and the week was a bit of a blur for me... Overall I was enjoying my workload at work quite a lot, I've got more into the thick of solving problems on the helpdesk team and the accumulative knowledge you gain from doing it day by day makes it much easier to solve each problem. At some point this week I ordered a big KFC, finished taking my medication, I drove a lot, I've ordered some new bits to finish fixing up my car, I followed an ambulance through traffic, I tried the limited edition dreamworks Coca-Cola (it was mid, hints of vanilla), I ate a lot of salads, somd random guy was changing his tire outside my house and I gave him a work lamp and he returned it on my doorstep with a fiver under it which was cute, I tipped a delivery guy a £20 note and he had the biggest smile on his face while saying "£20? Really?" which was a nice way to end the week.</p>
			<p>19/02/2023 - I went to the cafe and had a large breakfast, then went on an hour or so walk. Pondered over the pond and such. Very chill day overall.</p>
			<p>18/02/2023 - I got a haircut. I managed to get into my coinbase account and complete my order.</p>
			<p>17/02/2023 - This medication is upsetings my stomach and I'm losing my apitie. I placed and order for a grow kit today but my conbase account wouldn't let me send any payments because I hadn't logged in for ages ;(</p>
			<p>16/02/2023 - Weird day but the chicken bulgogi from pick a bap was extra nice.</p>
			<p>15/02/2023 - Today was cool I'm making loads of progress at work and picking up more problems. I had a meeting with the apprenticeship leader and that didn't seem to yeild too much negative feedback, although it was mostly just a checkup of my perspective on things. You'd be baffled by how computer illiterate some can be. I've started calling and taking calls from user's which is definitley the most fun bit of the role as you never know what to expect. The evening was a bit weird and took a bit of a sour turn but all together like 7/10 day.</p>
			<p>14/02/2023 - Some of the stuff people decide to share on their social media for Valentine's day is very strange and maybe a bit TMI... Regardless I spent most the day chilling as I had it off work and then went to see one of my friends at their house for a bit before going out later to a viewpoint in Fleet on top of a hill where you can see over the entirety of Church Crookham and all the way over to Farnborough airport. You can get really high up because there's a little wooden lookout structure on the middle of the site which gives you a perfect angle to see both of those at the same time. It's also a cool little area to explore and you can occupy a few hours by just walking around there. I was there for a while and it ran into midnight and that was basically all I did that day.</p>
			<p>13/02/2023 - I had a lesson with Keith but I got in late so I didn't get to waffle to him. Saw someone shoot a flare over the woods in the Old Dean. Just hung out with my friend for the evening.</p>
			<p>12/02/2023 - I spent most of the morning in bed and then a while at my friend's house throughout the day. I had a massive Chinese for dinner and could not finish the entire thing. How they make so much food for so little money is such a mystery to me.</p>
			<p>11/02/2023 - I was driving almost the entire day. I saw a big dog hanging out the window of a Toyota Hillux. Later in the evening I went to the pub and chilled with my friends for a while but that was about it for the day. Biscottiii!</p>
			<p>10/02/2023 - Not a lot happened today but I got my results back from the hospital and I'm getting my medication Thursday.</p>
			<p>09/02/2023 - On my way home I saw a man saving a small french bulldog from being stuck in the middle of the road. I swear they put less chicken in each packet of fridge raiders. Those self service checkouts are the best way to get rid of a lot of loose change.</p>
			<p>08/02/2023 - I went to the doctors today and they took my blood. I hate needles I actually felt like I was going to faint. Other than that I didn't do a lot. I got a parking ticket and I'm gonna try and appeal it by claiming there was in proper signage (@flarm). Someone I barely know really over shared about how their dog died and I was like 'oh'.</p>
			<p>07/02/2023 - * </p>
			<p>06/02/2023 - I started on a new team at work today. The people on the team are cool and team leader is very clear with his goals and expectations for the team. I think it'll be a good environment to expand my experience in and (hopefully) I'll learn a lot about customer interaction and different manors of problem solving.</p>
			<p>05/02/2023 - Bok! Pustio sam pticu iz kaveza! Croation is a really cool language, from what I have read about it, there's a lot that you would struggle to learn if you weren't living in Croatia, speaking to native Croation speakers. This is because they use a lot of short cuts and slang in their language. You could learn Croation from outside of Croatia and impress a Croation with your ability to speak coherant Croation, but you would struggle to fit in, and definitley wouldn't be mistaken for a local.</p>
			<p>04/02/2023 - I went out drinking with my friends who are studying at Uni at the moment, I rarely get to see one of them so it's cool when he's down. His family are Croation and I was asking him questions about Croation linguistics. I think I'm gonna try learn some basic phrases.</p>
			<p>03/02/2023 - Work work work work work work.</p>
			<p>02/02/2023 - I raced one of my friends today who has a 600cc 4 cylinder Honda motorbike. It was close but I pulled away on the top end. He should've beaten me by quite a bit but his bike is restricted and he topped out at 115. Regardless, it's the first time I've got the Celica over 120 since I've owned it and you can definitly feel the difference on the top end with the twin cam system. I've also properly attached my front plate so the car is entirely street legal.</p>
			<p>01/02/2023 - My counsellor seems pretty certain I'm dyslexic at some, not so servre, level. No real suprise there really. Other than that I didn't do a lot other than wonder round BnQ for a while.</p>
			<p>31/01/2023 - The radiator on the Celica was swapped, I test drove it and it made it to the end of the '331 without reaching the red line on the temp gauge. I think I'm gonna try and fix my astra and sell it on to some poor kid who doesn't know any better, as that's only got an overheating problem and it would probably be pretty easy to diognose with the knowledge I've gained from the Celica.</p>
			<p>30/01/2023 - I learn so much at work but nothing to do with my job or course I just sit there and research shit I'm interested in. My counsellor arranged a meeting with me today for Wednesday.</p>
			<p>29/01/2023 - I went for a test drive in the Celica in the early morning... the conclusion is that it's pissing out coolant from the radiator. I've ordered a new one. There's so much after market for it I might look at getting a bolt on super charger. I'll probably blow the engine up tho.</p>
			<p>28/01/2023 - I wrapped up the work I have been doing on my Toyota Celica. Every time I do work on my car all I can think about is how easy it would be with a car lift... and maybe an impact gun too. It was just two flat tires that needed replacing, I did everything else ages ago. There is some weird eletrical issue and it has been sometimes running flat without me using it but that should be pretty easy to diognose and fix. The bumper needs to be more secure too. I got to ragg it a little today and I can definitley say I missed driving it.</p>
			<p>27/01/2023 - The week is over and I've learned to much about HTML and CSS. I'm gonna try write on here every day so I and the people close to be can keep up with what I've been doing.</p>
