			<p>31/01/2023 - The radiator on the Celica was swapped, I test drove it and it made it to the end of the '331 without reaching the red line on the temp gauge. I think I'm gonna try and fix my astra and sell it on to some poor kid who doesn't know any better, as that's only got an overheating problem and it would probably be pretty easy to diognose with the knowledge I've gained from the Celica.</p>
			<p>30/01/2023 - I learn so much at work but nothing to do with my job or course I just sit there and research shit I'm interested in. My counsellor arranged a meeting with me today for Wednesday.</p>
			<p>29/01/2023 - I went for a test drive in the Celica in the early morning... the conclusion is that it's pissing out coolant from the radiator. I've ordered a new one. There's so much after market for it I might look at getting a bolt on super charger. I'll probably blow the engine up tho.</p>
			<p>28/01/2023 - I wrapped up the work I have been doing on my Toyota Celica. Every time I do work on my car all I can think about is how easy it would be with a car lift... and maybe an impact gun too. It was just two flat tires that needed replacing, I did everything else ages ago. There is some weird eletrical issue and it has been sometimes running flat without me using it but that should be pretty easy to diognose and fix. The bumper needs to be more secure too. I got to ragg it a little today and I can definitley say I missed driving it.</p>
			<p>27/01/2023 - The week is over and I've learned to much about HTML and CSS. I'm gonna try write on here every day so I and the people close to be can keep up with what I've been doing.</p>
