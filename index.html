			<p>09/02/2023 - On my way home I saw a man saving a small french bulldog from being stuck in the middle of the road. I swear they put less chicken in each packet of fridge raiders. Those self service checkouts are the best way to get rid of a lot of loose change.</p>
			<p>08/02/2023 - I went to the doctors today and they took my blood. I hate needles I actually felt like I was going to faint. Other than that I didn't do a lot. I got a parking ticket and I'm gonna try and appeal it by claiming there was in proper signage (@flarm). Someone I barely know really over shared about how their dog died and I was like 'oh'.</p>
			<p>07/02/2023 - * </p>
			<p>06/02/2023 - I started on a new team at work today. The people on the team are cool and team leader is very clear with his goals and expectations for the team. I think it'll be a good environment to expand my experience in and (hopefully) I'll learn a lot about customer interaction and different manors of problem solving.</p>
			<p>05/02/2023 - Bok! Pustio sam pticu iz kaveza! Croation is a really cool language, from what I have read about it, there's a lot that you would struggle to learn if you weren't living in Croatia, speaking to native Croation speakers. This is because they use a lot of short cuts and slang in their language. You could learn Croation from outside of Croatia and impress a Croation with your ability to speak coherant Croation, but you would struggle to fit in, and definitley wouldn't be mistaken for a local.</p>
			<p>04/02/2023 - I went out drinking with my friends who are studying at Uni at the moment, I rarely get to see one of them so it's cool when he's down. His family are Croation and I was asking him questions about Croation linguistics. I think I'm gonna try learn some basic phrases.</p>
			<p>03/02/2023 - Work work work work work work.</p>
			<p>02/02/2023 - I raced one of my friends today who has a 600cc 4 cylinder Honda motorbike. It was close but I pulled away on the top end. He should've beaten me by quite a bit but his bike is restricted and he topped out at 115. Regardless, it's the first time I've got the Celica over 120 since I've owned it and you can definitly feel the difference on the top end with the twin cam system. I've also properly attached my front plate so the car is entirely street legal.</p>
			<p>01/02/2023 - My counsellor seems pretty certain I'm dyslexic at some, not so servre, level. No real suprise there really. Other than that I didn't do a lot other than wonder round BnQ for a while.</p>
			<p>31/01/2023 - The radiator on the Celica was swapped, I test drove it and it made it to the end of the '331 without reaching the red line on the temp gauge. I think I'm gonna try and fix my astra and sell it on to some poor kid who doesn't know any better, as that's only got an overheating problem and it would probably be pretty easy to diognose with the knowledge I've gained from the Celica.</p>
			<p>30/01/2023 - I learn so much at work but nothing to do with my job or course I just sit there and research shit I'm interested in. My counsellor arranged a meeting with me today for Wednesday.</p>
			<p>29/01/2023 - I went for a test drive in the Celica in the early morning... the conclusion is that it's pissing out coolant from the radiator. I've ordered a new one. There's so much after market for it I might look at getting a bolt on super charger. I'll probably blow the engine up tho.</p>
			<p>28/01/2023 - I wrapped up the work I have been doing on my Toyota Celica. Every time I do work on my car all I can think about is how easy it would be with a car lift... and maybe an impact gun too. It was just two flat tires that needed replacing, I did everything else ages ago. There is some weird eletrical issue and it has been sometimes running flat without me using it but that should be pretty easy to diognose and fix. The bumper needs to be more secure too. I got to ragg it a little today and I can definitley say I missed driving it.</p>
			<p>27/01/2023 - The week is over and I've learned to much about HTML and CSS. I'm gonna try write on here every day so I and the people close to be can keep up with what I've been doing.</p>
